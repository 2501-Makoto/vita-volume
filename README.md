# Vita Volume

An application to set your vita volume level without using the buttons (if they happen to be broken like mine are)


# How to use

Set the value you want, 0 being the lowest and 30 the maximum (25 for AVLS forced vitas)


and then press square to reboot.

# How to build

First you need the vitasdk installed on your computer.
Then go in the directory and type
```cmake .```
then
```make```
And if everything is setup properly you should get the vpk.


## Prebuilt binaries

You can find prebuilt binaries [Here (Unknowncheats.me)](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/playstation/350121-ps-vita-vita-volume-app-set-vita-volume.html) if the download link isn't working, wait a bit, the file is still under verification and the UC staff has a lot of files to go through every day so it takes time.
